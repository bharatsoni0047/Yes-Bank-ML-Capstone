Yes Bank Stock Closing Price Prediction

Our main objective is to predict the stock’s closing price of the month.

Yes Bank is a well-known bank in the Indian financial domain. Since 2018, it has been in the news because of the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor.
Owing to this fact, it was interesting to see how that impacted the stock prices of the company and 
whether Time series models or any other predictive models can do justice to such situations.
This dataset has monthly stock prices of the bank since its inception and includes closing, starting, highest, and lowest stock prices of every month.

Role :-

Data Cleaning :-
 Dealing with null values, duplicate data and outliers present in our data.

Exploratory Data Analysis :-
 Plotting the dependent variable and distributions of dependent and independent variables. 
 Checking and visualizing the correlation between our dependent and independent variables. 
 Visualizing the relationship between each pair of our variables.

Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering :-
 Checking for and Dealing with multicollinearity present in our dataset. 
 Applying the log transform to deal with positively skewed data.  Scaling the data and splitting it into train and test sets.

Model Implementation :-
 Fitting various models on our data and optimizing them via cross-validation. 
 Using these models to make predictions on test and train data. 

The Models implemented are :-
Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
Ridge Regression
Elastic Net Regression

Data Visualization :-
 Using several kinds of charts like Line chart, scatter plot, heatmap, pair plot, distplot, boxplot etc to better visualize data and understand correlation and trends.

Model performance comparison :-
 Comparison of all implemented models using various Regression evaluation metrics like Mean absolute error, Mean squared error, RMSE, R-squared and Adjusted R-squared.

Conclusion :-
 Drawing some insights from the data and the predictions made by our various predictive models on unseen (test) data.
